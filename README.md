Boston All-Stars codebase!

The Boston Allstars is a group of graduating seniors from Boston-area teams we are gathering to build a robot for the 2023 game to compete at Summer Heat in Maine this summer. We currently have members from 6 teams:
FRC 246 ‘Lobstah Bots’,
FRC 1761 'STEAMpunk Tigers',
FRC 2423 ‘The KwarQs’,
FRC 2713 ‘Red Hawk Robotics’,
FRC 3205 'Patriots',
FRC 4761 ‘The Robockets’,
FRC 6201 ‘The Highlanders’,
and FRC 8604 ‘Alpha Centauri’.

The robot is programmed in the command-based style, and the codebase uses both AdvantageScope and Glass for telemetry.
